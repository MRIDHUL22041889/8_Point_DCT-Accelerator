# Pipelined 8-Point 1D DCT Hardware Accelerator

Overview

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a pipelined hardware accelerator for the 8-point 1D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT-II). The design is optimized for ASIC implementation and targets high throughput using a 4-stage pipeline, Canonical Signed Digit (CSD) multipliers, and a simple control/status register (CSR) interface. A testbench is included for functional verification and simulation.

Key features

- 4-stage pipelined 1D 8-point DCT core
- Streaming valid/ready handshake (AXI-like) for input/output flow control
- CSR-based control and status registers for start/stop and configuration
- CSD-based constant multipliers for hardware-efficient implementation
- Testbench for behavioral verification and simulation

Why this design

The DCT-II is widely used in image and video compression (e.g., JPEG, MPEG, HEVC). By transforming spatial-domain pixel values into frequency-domain coefficients, the DCT concentrates most of the signal energy in a small number of low-frequency coefficients â€” enabling efficient compression. A pipelined hardware accelerator provides low-latency, high-throughput DCT computation suitable for ASIC and FPGA integration.

Design summary

- Transform: 1D DCT-II, N = 8
- Pipeline stages: 4 (staged arithmetic with pipeline registers)
- Interface: Streaming valid/ready handshake (data_in_valid, data_in_ready, data_out_valid, data_out_ready)
- Control: CSR registers for configuration and status monitoring
- Target: ASIC (suitable for FPGA prototyping)

Mathematical definition (1D DCT-II)

For a 1D signal x[n] of length N:

X[k] = sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] * cos(pi/N * (n + 1/2) * k),  for k = 0..N-1

(The 2D DCT is obtained by applying the 1D DCT along rows and then columns.)

Getting started

Requirements

- Verilog simulator (Icarus Verilog, Verilator, QuestaSim, or similar)
- Make (optional) for running provided scripts
- Python (optional) for any testbench utilities or data generation

Quick simulation (example using Icarus Verilog)

1. Install Icarus Verilog (if not installed):
   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install iverilog vvp

2. From the repository root, run (example):
   iverilog -o tb_dct.vvp tb/*.v rtl/*.v && vvp tb_dct.vvp

Note: Exact file names and commands may vary depending on the testbench. Check /tb for a run script or Makefile.

Interfaces and handshake

This core is built around a streaming handshake to decouple producer/consumer timing from internal computation:

- data_in_valid (input): Indicates new input data is available from the producer
- data_in_ready (output): Asserts when the DCT core can accept the next input
- data_out_valid (output): Asserts when output data is valid and stable
- data_out_ready (input): Driven by the downstream consumer to accept output

The controller implements pipeline stall behavior: when data_out_valid is high and data_out_ready is low, the pipeline and output registers are frozen (no progress) to maintain data coherency.

Pipelined architecture

The core is split into 4 pipeline stages. Each stage performs part of the DCT arithmetic and stores intermediate results in pipeline registers. This organization enables a sustained throughput of one input per clock cycle after pipeline fill (latency = number of stages). The project uses CSD multipliers to reduce area and power while maintaining precision for constant multiplications.

Configuration and control

Control and status registers (CSR) provide a simple control plane to start/stop operation, poll status, and configure optional behavior. Check the CSR module in /rtl to see register offsets and control bits.

Testing and verification

- A behavioral testbench is included in /tb. Use it to run vectors and verify the functional correctness of the core.
- Recommended verification steps:
  1. Run the testbench and check that the output matches a golden-model DCT (software reference).
  2. Run corner-case vectors (all zeros, single non-zero input, maximum amplitudes).
  3. Add randomized stimulus and run through line-by-line comparison with a reference implementation (Python/NumPy).
